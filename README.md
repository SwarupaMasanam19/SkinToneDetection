# SkinToneDetection🎨

### **🔍 Overview**  
This project is a **Skin Tone Detection** system that identifies a user's skin tone from an **uploaded image or a live camera capture**. The detected skin tone is displayed with its **HEX code**, helping users choose fashion styles that best complement their complexion.  

### **📌 Features**  
✅ Detects skin tone from an **uploaded image** or **camera capture**  
✅ Displays the detected **HEX color code**  
✅ Fast and efficient **K-Means clustering** approach  
✅ Simple **React-based UI** for a smooth user experience  
✅ No dependency on Flask or backend servers  

### **🛠️ Technologies Used**  
- **Python** 🐍 (for image processing & ML)  
- **Pillow (PIL)** 📸 (for image handling)  
- **NumPy & Scikit-Learn** 📊 (for K-Means clustering)  


### **⚙️ Installation & Setup**  
#### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  

git clone https://github.com/SwarupaMasanam19/SkinToneDetection.git
cd SkinToneDetection


#### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:  
pip install -r requirements.txt


#### **3️⃣ Run the Application**  

- **For Python Model (if needed):**  
  python model.py


### **📸 How It Works**  
1️⃣ Upload an image
2️⃣ The model processes the image and extracts the **dominant skin tone**  
3️⃣ The detected **HEX color code** is displayed on the UI  
4️⃣ Use this information for personalized fashion recommendations!  

### **🚀 Future Improvements**  
🔹 Improve accuracy using **Deep Learning (CNNs)**  
🔹 Integrate with the **AI-Powered Fashion Revolution** project  
🔹 Add a **rule-based suggestion system** for outfit recommendations
